# SUSE Telco Cloud examples

This repository contains some examples of how to deploy SUSE Telco Cloud in different environments.

## Releases

This repository is organized into release branches. Each release contains a set of examples that are compatible with a specific version of SUSE Telco Cloud.
The following branches (releases) are available:

- `main`: The latest development version of SUSE Telco Cloud.
- `release-3.0`: [Release 3.0 of SUSE Telco Cloud](https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/release-3.0)
- `release-3.1`: [Release 3.1 of SUSE Telco Cloud](https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/release-3.1)
- `release-3.2`: [Release 3.2 of SUSE Telco Cloud](https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/release-3.2)
- `release-3.3`: [Release 3.3 of SUSE Telco Cloud](https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/release-3.3)
- `release-3.4`: [Release 3.4 of SUSE Telco Cloud](https://github.com/suse-edge/telco-cloud-examples/tree/release-3.4)

## Scenarios

Note that ipv6, dual-stack and aarch64 scenarios are currently tech-preview and not yet fully supported.

- Single-node Clusters
- Multi-node Clusters
- DHCP Network scenarios, single or dual-stack
- DHCP-less Network scenarios, single or dual-stack
- Air gap scenarios for management cluster
- Additional cacerts to use external TLS file server for managment cluster (to server images over HTTPS)
- Air gap scenarios for downstream clusters
- CPU Manager scenarios
- AARCH64 architecture:
  1. Tech Preview for full aarch64 e2e, mgmt-cluster and downstream clusters using aarch64 architecture
  2. x86_64 Management clusters to deploy both x86_64 and aarch64 downstream clusters

**NOTE:** Adding the label `cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import: "true"` to the `cluster.x-k8s.io` objects will import the cluster
into Rancher (by creating a corresponding `clusters.management.cattle.io` object).
See the [Cluster API documentation](https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/cluster-api/latest/en/tutorials/first-cluster.html#_mark_namespace_for_auto_import) for more information.
